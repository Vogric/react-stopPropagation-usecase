### Understanding Event Bubbling and Stop Propagation

ðŸ«§ Event Bubbling:

When you click on an element inside another element, like clicking on a button within a div, the click event doesn't just trigger on the button; it also "bubbles up" through its parent elements. So, the button's click event fires first, then its parent's click event, and so on up the DOM tree ðŸŒ³. This process is called event bubbling.

----------------------------------------------------------------

- ### Issue:

Without stopPropagation(), clicking the child element would trigger both the child and the parent event handlers.

- ### Solution:

stopPropagation() ðŸš«:
Now, when you click the child element, the parent's click event won't be triggered anymore
